      <h2>Stanley Kubrick: The Director Who Changed Cinema Forever</h2>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/bgrWd7Sf/stanley-kubrick.png" alt="Stanley Kubrick" class="article-banner">
      <p><em>Published July 2025 by NICOLAS, EUAN ROIE</em></p>

      <p>
        When people talk about the greatest filmmakers of all time, Stanley Kubrick's name is almost always included in the
        conversation.
        Kubrick, who was famously meticulous and often demanded dozens of takes for a single scene, pushed the boundaries of
        what cinema could achieve.
        Known for his perfectionism, artistic vision and technical innovation, he redefined what movies could be.
        Kubrick’s approach to filmmaking has been studied and applied by generations of directors.
        
        While nearly all of Kubrick’s films are influential and widely acclaimed, this article will focus on three of his most
        iconic works that showcase
        his unique contributions to cinema: Paths of Glory, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon. Through these films, we can
        explore how Kubrick
        transformed visual storytelling, challenged genre conventions and left a permanent mark on the art of filmmaking.
        
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/ycPMRqdL/paths-of-glory.png" alt="Paths of Glory" class="article-banner">
        
        Kubrick's early success came with Paths of Glory (1957), a powerful anti-war film set during World War I which was based
        on a novel of the same name.
        The film showcased his early mastery of visual tension and moral complexity. Its memorable tracking shots and stark
        black-and-white imagery emphasized
        the absurdity of war and the cruelty of military hierarchy. It was a film that made people question the purpose of war.
        Praised by critics for its
        unflinching portrayal of injustice on the battlefield, it established Kubrick as a serious filmmaker and laid the
        foundation for his later war-themed works.

        More than a decade later, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) redefined what science fiction could be. With minimal dialogue, a
        non-linear narrative and
        groundbreaking special effects, the film expanded the boundaries of cinematic storytelling. Kubrick used slow pacing,
        classical music and precise
        imagery to explore artificial intelligence, human evolution and the mysteries of the universe—concepts rarely treated
        with such artistic seriousness in the genre.
        The film’s iconic HAL 9000, which is an artificial intelligence system that turns on its crew, remains one of the most
        chilling portrayals of AI in film history.
        Over fifty years since its release, 2001 is still regarded as a masterclass in immersive, thought-provoking filmmaking.

        While 2001 looked toward the future, Barry Lyndon (1975) turned to the past. This historical epic, which follows the
        rise and fall of an ambitious
        Irishman in the 18th century, is praised for its painterly visuals and innovative cinematography. Kubrick used natural
        lighting and candlelight
        to recreate the look of 18th-century paintings, giving the film a unique and timeless aesthetic. Its deliberate pacing
        and detached narration reflect
        themes of fate, social class and personal downfall. Though it received mixed reviews upon release, Barry Lyndon is now
        considered one of the most
        visually stunning films ever made. Its influence is seen in modern period dramas, many of which have adopted similar
        lighting and composition techniques.
        
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/tTFQnk9v/stanley-kubrick-2.png" alt="Barry Lyndon" class="article-banner">
        
        Even decades after his death, Kubrick’s legacy remains powerful. His films continue to be studied around the world as
        essential material for
        understanding cinematography, narrative structure and visual storytelling. His contributions have been praised by
        countless directors who
        credit him as a major influence on their work. His use of lighting, framing and sound, as well as the depth of his
        themes, continues to inspire
        generations of filmmakers and critics.<br><br>
        
        In an industry often shaped by commercial trends and formulaic storytelling, Kubrick stood out as a true
        visionary—someone who
        believed that cinema could be both artistic and intellectually profound. He was a filmmaker whose influence can still be
        seen in the
        work of directors today. Stanley Kubrick was more than just a great director. He was the director who changed cinema
        forever.
