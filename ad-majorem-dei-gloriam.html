      <p><em>Published July 2025 by ALVARADO, RAFAEL ALLAN</em></p>

      <p>An altar server is usually a young person who helps the priest during liturgical services like the Mass.
        They carefully prepare the sacred vessels and sometimes the vestments used in the Mass. We see them carrying
        and ringing bells called Sanctus bells. They may also hold candles and incense. Those who want to become
        altar servers should be willing to dedicate their time and serve the Lord wholeheartedly. It’s a wonderful
        opportunity to answer a call to serve the Lord, and it helps deepen faith and understanding of the Mass.
        Altar servers make sure that the Mass runs smoothly and that parishioners can pray without distraction. <br><br>

        <b>Requirements and Training</b><br>
        A layperson interested in serving should be a Catholic who has received their First Communion. Everyone
        who wants to serve is welcome, but they should show respect and dedication to their role. All altar servers
        go through training or practice to prepare for assisting the priest during Mass. They are also encouraged
        to join formation sessions to deepen their understanding of the liturgy and the Catholic faith. <br><br>

        <b>Challenges and Rewards</b><br>
        Some challenges of being an altar server include being judged by others for not being ‘holy’
        enough and sacrificing personal time. Often, they are judged simply because they made a mistake
        that might seem to lessen their sense of holiness. It’s important to remember that altar servers
        are human and can make mistakes. The Church welcomes all, including those still growing in their
        faith. Being an altar server often means giving up some personal time, sometimes early in the morning,
        to fulfill church responsibilities. This can be tough for students balancing church duties and school.
        Serving as an altar server is a rewarding experience that helps young people grow in faith, responsibility,
        and confidence. It allows them to actively participate in the Mass, build friendships, and develop a strong
        sense of belonging within the Church. Through regular participation in worship, they deepen their relationship
        with God and grow both personally and spiritually. <br><br>

        <b>Meeting of Pope Francis with the German Altar Servers</b><br>
        As the late Pope Francis said, “It is important to recognize that being close to Jesus and knowing Him
        in the Eucharist through your ministry at the altar allows you to open yourself to others, journey together,
        set challenging goals, and find the strength to achieve them. Recognizing our smallness and weakness, while
        understanding that, with Jesus’ support, we may be strengthened and take on the task of life’s great journey
        in His company, brings us immense happiness.” (Francis, 2015, Address to the National Pilgrimage of German
        Altar Servers). <br><br>

        <b>Story of St. Tarcisius</b><br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/BVJ0gL6G/St-Tarcisius.jpg" alt="Saint Tarcisius" class="article-banner" style="object-fit:contain">
        During Emperor Valerian’s persecution of Christians in third-century Rome, St. Tarcisius was a young altar server and
        Eucharistic victim. He bravely volunteered to bring the Eucharist to imprisoned believers but was attacked by pagan boys
        who suspected him of carrying the “Mysteries.” He was battered to death while still clutching the Eucharist. According
        to tradition, the Hosts became one with him. He is the patron saint of altar servers and children participating in
        Nocturnal Adoration and is known for his strong devotion to the Eucharist (HM Webcam, 2017c).
        <br><br>
        In serving the Lord, we always say Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, which means for the greater glory of God. May we, like St.
        Tarcisius, courageously live out our faith with an unwavering love for the Eucharist, willing to serve and stand firm in
        the face of adversity.<br><br>
