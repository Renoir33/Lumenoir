      <h2>The Hidden Risks of Relying Too Heavily on ChatGPT for Critical Thinking</h2>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mr8Vyy23/Risks-of-GPT-reliance.png" alt="Risks of GPT reliance" class="article-banner" style="object-fit:fill">
      <p><em>Published July 2025 by MANANGU, REDENELLE MAURICE</em></p>

      <p>
        ChatGPT has been welcomed as a breakthrough tool in schools and companies throughout
        the world that can automate tasks and increase productivity. However, current research
        raises concerns about overreliance on artificial intelligence for cognitive activities. While
        ChatGPT has unquestionable advantages, over-reliance on it presents significant risks to
        our core thinking processes. <br><br>

        <b>The Cognitive Decline Connection</b><br>
        An important MIT study found that extended ChatGPT use causes important brain damage.
        Researchers that followed participants for four months revealed that those who used
        ChatGPT continuously failed at neurological, linguistic, and behavioral levels. Participants
        whose brain activity was evaluated with electroencephalograms had the lowest brain
        activation when compared to those who used traditional research methods. <br>
        Researchers refer to this phenomenon as "cognitive offloading," in which individuals
        outsource their analytical obligations to AI systems. The process that should strengthen
        critical thinking skills weakens as it is used less. Students who rely significantly on
        ChatGPT for essay writing and problem-solving face what experts refer to as "cognitive
        debt," a shortfall in learning abilities that builds over time. <br><br>

        <b>The Trust Trap</b><br>
        Another concerning finding from Microsoft research is that confidence in AI's capabilities
        correlates inversely with human critical thinking engagement. The more people rely on
        ChatGPT to accomplish complicated tasks, the less they use their own analytical muscles.
        This creates a dangerous cycle in which users who looked for efficiency gradually lose the
        skills that allowed them to think effectively. <br>
        Young people appear to be particularly vulnerable to this trend. According to studies,
        participants aged 17-25 with more AI reliance consistently scored poorer on critical
        thinking evaluations than older persons. This generational split implies that digital natives,
        whose educational experiences increasingly include AI technologies, may be sacrificing
        long-term cognitive growth in favor of short-term convenience. <br><br>

        <b>The Passive Learning Problem</b><br>
        Traditional learning requires active engagement with information, questioning sources,
        analyzing arguments, and synthesizing ideas. ChatGPT, however, presents information in a
        polished, authoritative manner that discourages scrutiny. Students who receive AIgenerated responses often accept them without the critical evaluation that would normally
        accompany human-produced content. <br>
        This passive consumption of information, which bypasses the struggle inherent in learning,
        undermines the development of essential academic skills. The research process, with its
        messy exploration, dead ends, and gradual understanding, gets replaced by instant
        answers that provide solutions without fostering comprehension. <br><br>
        
        <b>Finding Balance</b><br>
        The solution lies not in abandoning AI technology but in establishing boundaries that
        preserve critical thinking development. Educational institutions and individuals must
        recognize that ChatGPT works best as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement for
        human analysis. When users maintain active engagement with AI-generated content,
        questioning, verifying, and building upon it, they can harness the technology's benefits
        while protecting their cognitive abilities. <br>
        Ultimately, our relationship with ChatGPT should mirror our relationship with any powerful
        tool: respectful, intentional, and balanced. The goal should be augmenting human
        intelligence rather than replacing it, ensuring that we remain the architects of thinking
        while benefiting from AI's computational power. <br><br>
