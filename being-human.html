      <p><em>Published July 2025 by VITERO, JARED GABRIEL</em></p>

      <p><b><i>"Your choices, your actions, that's what makes you who you are."</i></b>These simple
          yet powerful words from Pa Kent to Clark Kent resonate far beyond the screen,
          especially in a world as fractured and painful as ours today. The 2025 Superman film
          reintroduces the Man of Steel not as a distant, invincible figure, but as a symbol of what
          we could be: hopeful, kind, and brave in the face of cruelty. As real-world horrors like
          the genocide in Palestine unfold before our eyes, Superman’s example feels urgent. He
          reminds us that power isn’t just about strength but about what you choose to do with it.
          And in a time when so many turn away, this version of Superman turns toward those
          who are suffering, not to save them with might alone, but to stand with them, a beacon
          of empathy in a world desperate for it. <br><br>
          <b>What Hope Means in Modern Times</b><br>
          Hope isn’t blind optimism; it’s a conscious decision to believe in the possibility of
          change, even when the world feels broken. The new Superman doesn’t ignore pain or
          pretend evil doesn’t exist; he faces it head-on, with compassion as his weapon. In a
          time when headlines are filled with violence, injustice, and dehumanization, hope can
          feel naive. But this Superman shows that hope is not weakness; it’s resistance. It’s
          refusing to give in to cynicism. His unwavering belief in humanity reminds us that even
          amid genocide, displacement, or hatred, standing up, speaking out, and caring still
          matter. Superman doesn't just give us hope; he challenges us to live it. <br><br>
          <b>Kindness as Strength</b><br>
          In a world where cruelty is normalized, kindness becomes a quiet form of rebellion. True
          strength isn’t loud or forceful; it’s found in restraint, in mercy, and in care for the smallest
          and most overlooked. One moment in the film captures this perfectly: Superman takes a
          moment during chaos to save a squirrel. An act so simple, yet profoundly telling. It’s a
          reminder that every life has value, that heroism isn’t always grand gestures. When the
          world tells us to harden ourselves, kindness asks us to stay soft and, in that softness, to
          find real courage. <br><br>
          <b>Compassion & Empathy in Action</b><br>
          Compassion is more than a feeling; it’s a choice. A choice to acknowledge suffering
          when ignoring it would be easier. In times like these, when communities are devastated
          by war, genocide, poverty, or natural disasters like flooding, empathy becomes a form of
          protest. It means refusing to let tragedy become background noise. The film reflects this
          truth not through spectacle, but through intention. We are reminded by the film that real
          heroism begins with simply caring. When we allow ourselves to see others fully, their
          pain becomes impossible to dismiss. And when we respond with action, no matter how
          small, we remind the world and ourselves that love and hope still have a place in it. <br><br>
          <b>Why We Need Superman Today</b><br>
          In a world that feels increasingly numb to cruelty, the need isn’t for someone to save us,
          but for reminders that we still have the power to save each other. Superman isn’t a
          distant ideal; he’s a reflection of the choice we all face daily: to be indifferent or to care.
          His story challenges us to resist the pull of apathy, to stay soft when everything tells us
          to harden. And maybe that’s the real message: that hope isn’t found in extraordinary
          power, but in ordinary people who choose to do good anyway. Especially when the
          world makes it the hardest.
